# Tauri Icons

Here's the process I've been using to create icons:

- Save source image as `app-icon.png` in `packages/desktop`
- `cd` to `src-tauri`
- Run `bun tauri icons -o icons/{environment}`
- Use [Image2Icon](https://img2icnsapp.com/)'s 'Big Sur Icon' preset to generate an `icon.icns` file and place it in the appropriate icons folder

The Image2Icon step is necessary as the `icon.icns` generated by `app-icon.png` does not apply the shadow/padding expected by macOS,
so app icons appear larger than expected.
