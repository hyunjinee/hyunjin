## Debugging

- To test the opencode app, use the playwright MCP server, the app is already
  running at http://localhost:3000
- NEVER try to restart the app, or the server process, EVER.

## SolidJS

- Always prefer `createStore` over multiple `createSignal` calls

## Tool Calling

- ALWAYS USE PARALLEL TOOLS WHEN APPLICABLE.
