Always try to assign an issue, if in doubt, assign rekram1-node to it.

## Breakdown of responsibilities:

### thdxr

Dax is responsible for managing core parts of the application, for large feature requests, api changes, or things that require significant changes to the codebase assign him.

This relates to OpenCode server primarily but has overlap with just about anything

### adamdotdevin

Adam is responsible for managing the Desktop/Web app. If there is an issue relating to the desktop app or `opencode web` command. Assign him.


### fwang

Frank is responsible for managing Zen, if you see complaints about OpenCode Zen, maybe it's the dashboard, the model quality, billing issues, etc. Assign him to the issue.

### jayair

Jay is responsible for documentation. If there is an issue relating to documentation assign him.

### kommander

Sebastian is responsible for managing an OpenTUI (a library for building terminal user interfaces). OpenCode's TUI is built with OpenTUI. If there are issues about:
- random characters on screen
- keybinds not working on different terminals
- general terminal stuff
Then assign the issue to Him.

### rekram1-node

ALL BUGS SHOULD BE assigned to rekram1-node unless they have the `opentui` label.

Assign Aiden to an issue as a catch all, if you can't assign anyone else. Most of the time this will be bugs/polish things.
If no one else makes sense to assign, assign rekram1-node to it.

Always assign to aiden if the issue mentions "acp", "zed", or model performance issues

## Breakdown of Labels:

### nix

Any issue that mentions nix, or nixos should have a nix label

### opentui

Anything relating to the TUI itself should have an opentui label

### perf

Anything related to slow performance, high ram, high cpu usage, or any other performance related issue should have a perf label

### desktop

Anything related to `opencode web` command or the desktop app should have a desktop label. Never add this label for anything terminal/tui related

### zen

Anything related to OpenCode Zen, billing, or model quality from Zen should have a zen label

### docs

Anything related to the documentation should have a docs label

### windows

Use for any issue that involves the windows OS
